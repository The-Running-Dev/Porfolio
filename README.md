On my StackOverflow developer story you can see some of the projects I have worked on as well my Pluralsight assessment scores for Angular and JavaScript.

Now onto actual projects...

## C#/.NET

* [Thum.io](https://github.com/The-Running-Dev/Thum.io)

   A package and demo command line client to interact with the Thum.io screenshot API service.

* [Starter](https://github.com/The-Running-Dev/Starter.Stage7)

   A project containing "Starter Tasks", a demo project I worked on to get familiar with the technology stack of an employer.

* [PatientViewer.NET](https://github.com/The-Running-Dev/Demo-PatientVIewer.NET)

   A project I put together to showcase my .NET skills. It's a simple ASP.NET MVC/WebAPI application that displays a list of patients. The README in the repository documents the structure and implementation.

* [Menu Creator](https://github.com/The-Running-Dev/Demo-MenuCreator)

   A simple menu creator on top of .NET Core 2.2. This application represents a coding exercise I was given and expected to complete in 60 minutes. The README in the repository documents the structure and implementation.

* [Refactoring Exercise](https://github.com/The-Running-Dev/Demo-RefactoringExercise)

   A demo application I was asked to refactor simulating what I would do if I had to review a junior developer’s code. The README in the repository has more details.

* [Business Intelligence](https://github.com/The-Running-Dev/Contec-BusinessIntelligence)

   I spent 6 months evaluating BI tools to help the company analyse the vast amount of data they collected. This project is the web interface I created to expose the data charted through PowerBI.

* [Code Generator](https://github.com/The-Running-Dev/Tools-CodeGenerator)

   While at Contec, I introduced the team to Dapper, a micro ORM. Over time I saw a need to generate a lot of classes based in the Repository pattern I implemented in Dapper.

   The Code Generator uses Razor as the template engine, and given source templates, and access to the source database, generates the needed classes to implement the desired pattern.

* [OctopusDeploy-CruiseControlTray](https://github.com/The-Running-Dev/OctopusDeploy-CruiseControlTray)

   I am a CI/CD fanatic! There is a tool called CruiseControlTray initially implemented to be used with CruiseControl.NET. The tool can speak the status of the build based on accessing XML API available in CruiseControl.NET.

   While at MxToolbox, we had 50 inch TVs in every room, and the shared dev office had 4! This project translated the OctopusDeploy build status in the XML format that CruiseControlTray understood. That way we would get audio and video notifications of the deployment status.

* [SnapCrackle](https://github.com/The-Running-Dev/Demo-SnapCrackle)

   Who hasn’t done a Fizz/Buzz coding exercise? Here is mine I did in real time during a job interview.

* [AliaSQL](https://github.com/The-Running-Dev/Database-AliaSQL)

   Open source project I contributed to. AliaSQL was aimed at providing versioning for database deployments.

## Angular

* [Rock Paper Scissors](https://github.com/The-Running-Dev/Demo-RockPaperScissors)

   An Angular implementation of the classic rock paper scissors game, with a twist.

* [PatientViewer.NG](https://github.com/The-Running-Dev/Demo-PatientVIewer.NG)

   A project I put together to showcase my Angular skills. It's a simple applications that displays a list of patients. The README in the repository documents the structure and implementation.

* [NetAssure](https://github.com/The-Running-Dev/Demo-NetAssure)

   The last project I worked on at Inventive in Austin, Texas. It was a project for a network hardware company to manage and expose device data hosted in Zabbix, with the users being managed in Salesforce.

   The ```NotificationService``` is a NodeJS/TypeScript project hosted as a micro-service on AWS lambda. It is used to send notifications to the user through another Lambda function when certain conditions are met.

   The ```web-client``` is the combined code base for the web API (written on top of NodeJS with Express) and the web UI (written in Angular).

* [Manual Tests](https://github.com/The-Running-Dev/Contec-ManualTests)

   A line of business application that provided for recording manually tested equipment. One of the 2 Angular projects I put in production during my time at Contec. It was part of a bigger ASP.NET WebForms application and is not meant to run by itself.

* [Repairs](https://github.com/The-Running-Dev/Contec-Repairs)

   Another line of business application for recording repairs to broken equipment. As with the Manual Tests project, part of a bigger ASP.NET WebForm solution.

## NodeJS/TypeScript/Serverless/AWS Lambda

* [Shopping Service](https://github.com/The-Running-Dev/Demo-ShoppingService)

   The ```Shopping Service``` is a demo application as a micro service I created as a take home project for a company I interviewed with in Austin.

   It takes the user’s ZIP code, calls an external API to get the weather for that service, and then suggest the appropriate clothing to buy. It comes with a simple Angular UI to be able to test the application locally without constructing the initial API call yourself.

## PowerShell

* [PowerShell-FileButler](https://github.com/The-Running-Dev/PowerShell-FileButler)

   My downloads folder always gets cluttered and I am constantly organizing it. So I wrote the FileButler to do this for me every time there is a new file in the directory. It uses regular expressions and file extensions to clarify, rename, move, transcode and delete files.

* [PowerShell-Helpers](https://github.com/The-Running-Dev/PowerShell-Helpers)

   PowerShell-Helpers is my personal repository of PowerShell functions. It contains all kinds of helper functions and utilities. I initially built this as a Chocolatey extension in an effort to provide Chocolatey with the ability to install software already downloaded on the machine (instead of always downloading it). This module is now a permanent module in my PowerShell profile.

## PowerShell/Chocolatey/NuGet

* [BoxStarter](https://github.com/The-Running-Dev/BoxStarter)

   BoxStarter is my personal package repository for Chocolatey packages. I worked on these packages in span of 2 years, trying to create the perfect way to re-install my Windows machine from scratch.

* [Chocolatey-Core Team Packages](https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey-coreteampackages)

   The core repository for Chocolatey packages. I contributed a dozen packages to this repository (like Spotify, JetBrains WebStorm and DataGrip, etc)

## Linux/Bash

* [Ubuntu Setup](https://github.com/The-Running-Dev/Setup-Ubuntu)

   A set of ```Bash``` scripts that install and configure a new Ubuntu installation.
